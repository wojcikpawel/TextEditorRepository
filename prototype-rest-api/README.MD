# Creating a RESTful API with Node.js
This repository accompanies my YouTube video series on building a RESTful API with Node.js: [https://github.com/academind/node-restful-api-tutorial.git](https://github.com/academind/node-restful-api-tutorial.git)

## Usage
Check out the branch you're interested in (i.e. which belongs to the video in my series you just watched), ```git clone``` it and thereafter run ```npm install```.

## Run REST-API:
* Run Node.js Server:
```sh
node server.js
```
* Run Browser or Postman and type following endpoints:
```sh
http://localhost:5000/EndpointsOrders/komunikatzamowienie
```
```sh
http://localhost:5000/EndpointsProducts/komunikatprodukt
```
